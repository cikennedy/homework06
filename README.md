  ## Description

  The application is a weather dashboard that allows users to search for weather in a given city. The user will be met with the city's current weather, UV index, and five day forecast. The user's search history will be saved on the page.

  The application utilizes the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve the weather data and stores data using the localStorage property.
